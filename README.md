# CPU-scheduler
Implementing various CPU scheduling algorithms in C++ is a great way to grasp the impact of different scheduling methods on system performance and efficiency. Below is a C++ program with frontend for inputs and outputs in python that illustrates the implementation of each specified CPU scheduling algorithm: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Process Next (SPN), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN), Feedback (FB), and Aging.
